# SF-Building-Permit-Data

This repository shows python notebooks used as a project on San Francisco housing additions from 2012 to 2016. Data comes from the SF Planning Deparment's
development pipeline data. The goal of the project is to focus on differences in intra-urban housing development rather than aggregate city-level or metropolitan-level housing change.
